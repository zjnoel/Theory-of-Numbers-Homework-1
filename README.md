# Theory-of-Numbers-Homework-1
Some basic code to demonstrate conjectures that are given to prove or disprove.

# Prove or disprove the following:
If gcd(m,n) = d, then gcd(a,mn) = gcd(a, m) * gcd(a,n) / d

If p is prime and p | a or p | b, then p | ab.

If p is prime and p | ab, then p | a or p | b.

Repeat questions 2 and 3, but replace prime p with composite n
